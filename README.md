All examples for https://threejs.org/  (you can download kit from the page https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) need to use a local server ... this chrome server i see that working good https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb

So... save three.js kit in documents for example and install chrome server and unselect and select "Automatically show index.html"  from chrome server and select folder  Documents\three.js-dev\three.js-dev ... and open examples and click any example with extension html.
